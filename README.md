# fal-scribble

This is a basic implementation of an arbitrary number of canvases to use as scribble control net inputs for my comfyui "sketch" workflow on fal.ai.
I think you can find it on there and change it.
It uses AnimagineXLv3.1, I intend to add the ability to change the model. 
Change "YOUR_FAL_CREDENTIALS" to your fal api key. 
Then run "npm install" and "npm start".
